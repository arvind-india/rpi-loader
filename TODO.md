# Thing That Require Attention

-----

* High Priority
    * When running the scripts with `sudo`, files are created with root ownership.  Needs to be in the ownership of the login (e.g. jeff or pi)
    * Using `getopt`, pass argument for HOME, ROOT, etc.
    * Have the script print comments about what its doing as the packages are load.  This is particularly tneeded for `part-5.sh`.
* Low Priority
    * Create a script you can use to copy the image to a file and copy that image to SD-Card
    * Use the scrip to make a Docker or Resin.io package.
